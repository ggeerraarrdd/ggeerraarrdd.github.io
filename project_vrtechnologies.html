                    <p>
                        VRTechnologies is a prototype information system for data sourcing and quality assurance at a
                        fictional start-up company in the home sharing industry. It was developed using MS Access and
                        VBA.
                    </p>

                    <div class="heading">User Stories</div>
                    <p>
                        The features of the system are based on business requirements as captured in the following user
                        stories:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>"As a data analyst, I want to see on a graphic user interface the data scraped from home
                            sharing platforms like Airbnb of a property whose street address has not been identified by
                            other data analysts so that I can find and enter its location."</li>
                        <li>"As a QA analyst, I want to see on a graphic user interface the STR property addresses that
                            have been submitted by data analysts so that I can inspect their accuracy, correct any
                            mistakes and pass/fail their overall quality."</li>
                        <li>"As an implementation project manager, I want to see on a dashboard the data sourcing
                            progress for my customers so that I can efficiently schedule the implementation timelines of
                            my portfolio."</li>
                        <li>"As an implementation project manager, I want toe able to alert the operations manager via a
                            notification system so that I can escalate any critical implementation issues that I observe
                            from the data analyst and QA teams."</li>
                        <li>"As an operations manager, I want to see KPI of individual data and QA analysts on a
                            dashboard so that I can track their performance."</li>
                        <li>"As an operations manager, I want to manage systems access so that users can open only the
                            dashboards they need to perform their job."</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        All user stories were implemented except for #4 and #6, which is partially implemented without
                        live data.
